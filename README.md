Jewels is a [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org) plugin game similar to
Candy Crush and lots of others: you begin with a rectangular grid filled with
squares of various colours.  When there are three or more squares of the
same colour in a horizontal or vertical line (a *mono*) they disappear, your score
increases, then the blocks above them fall down to fill their place and are
replaced at the top with randomly chosen new ones.  A move swaps two horizontally or
vertically adjacent blocks to create a mono; when there are no moves
available
the game is over.

I used to play Jewels with the strategy of trying to make moves near the
top of the board, but I got to wondering whether there was a simple
better alternative...
